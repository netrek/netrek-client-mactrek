/*
 * The Socket class must be supplied with an NSMutableData object
 * on each read and appends the data that was read from the 
 * BSD-socket, but will often return with more or less data than
 * the caller requires. This forces the programmer to keep track of 
 * additional data that is read.
 *
 * The BufferedSocket class internally buffers the data read from 
 * the Socket and implements messages that can
 * a) read a specified amount of data
 * b) read data until a secified pattern is found
 *
