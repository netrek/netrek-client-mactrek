	<string>Cruiser vs. Battleship (BB)

The BB is the only ship larger than the CA, and must be treated as such. I find the best method is either to just get around the BB (using your higher combat speed) or try to stay at range and get some torp hits in before the BB can close. You need about 7 torp hits to kill the BB, and you should probably get half of those before closing. Your phasers do less damage than the BB's, so try to avoid getting into a phaser battle: you'll lose. Stick to your photons which do the same damage as BB photons.</string>
	<string>Battleship vs. Cruiser (CA)

Battleships are the best cruiser-killers.  Cruisers can't dodge significantly better than BB's, their phasers are a lot weaker, and their pressors aren't strong enough to keep a determined battleship away.  You also need to do 60 less damage to them than they need to do to you.  The most efficient way to kill them is the Tractor-Phaser Method: Tractor them in and dodge; their retaliatory string of torps will usually go to the place you just dodged from.  Phaser and dodge the other way.  Repeat, adding torps when necessary.  You'll be surprised how little damage they're able to do to you if you get in a groove.</string>
